`Top-Down Approach`-make the larger objects first and then smaller objects

We're gonna use bottom-up approach for this question

### We'll first find how many objects are there

a.Menu Item-Code,name,price-ths class is also a modal class since it has variables and getters-setters and no functionality

1.Restaurant- id,name,address, Menu Items

```
a-1 has a "has a " relationship (restaurant has a menu)(
Composition Relationship-In an example of chair it has arms,seat,wheels, and these components canâ€™t exist independently, thus they have a composition relationship, it is represented by a closed diamond.
)
```

Now, restaurants aren't fixed they can be added and deleted and to manage it we'll create another object
b. **_Restaurant Manager_** -performs CRUD operations on restaurants,can search restaurant based on location,has list of all the restaurants
Every manager class is a singelton class

```
b-1 is a "has-a" relationship but a restaurant can exist without a manager and a restaurant exists inside the restaurant manager(
    Aggregation Relationship-the main object acts as an aggregator,it acts as a container,like a room will contain sofa,chair,bed.It is stronger than a simple has-a relationship,since the connection is more complex,represented by diamond operator.
)
```

We don't want anyone to directly access the restaurant,the user should deal with the the restaurant manager which will deal with the restaurant

2.User(modal class)-id,name,address,cart(Every user has one cart)
c.Cart-restaurant,menu items,total(),addtocart(item),clear(),isEmpty().

```c-1-Simple Association Relation,One-to-One
c-a simple association,one-to-many relationship
c-2 Composition Relationship, cart can't exist without a user
```
